Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

From AWS Config,
- ALB HTTP to HTTPS Redirection: Lack of redirection from HTTP to HTTPS can expose data in transit
- ALB HTTP Drop Invalid Header: Accepting invalid headers can lead to security vulnerabilities such as header injection attacks
- EC2 No Public IP: EC2 instances with public IPs are more exposed to attacks from the internet

From AWS SecurityHub,
- Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to port 22 
- Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to port 3389
- VPC default security groups should not allow inbound or outbound traffic
- VPC flow logging should be enabled in all VPCs
- CloudTrail should be enabled and configured with at least one multi-Region trail that includes read and write management events
