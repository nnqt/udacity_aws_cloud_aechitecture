# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

The GuardDuty finding indicates that the EC2 instance (ID: i-0b44094e0fd8e0542) is performing SSH brute force attacks against another EC2 instance (IP: 10.192.10.179). 
This type of attack is typically characterized by the repeated guessing of SSH passwords in an attempt to gain unauthorized access to the target instance. 
The finding is categorized as "High" severity, indicating an urgent security concern that should be addressed.

GuardDuty detects SSH brute force attacks by looking at different sources of information. According to the AWS GuardDuty documentation, 
it analyzes VPC Flow Logs to see repeated connection attempts from the attacker's IP address (18.212.141.49) trying to access the target instance's SSH port (22). 
It also checks AWS CloudTrail logs to find any related activity and looks at DNS logs for any suspicious domain name requests. Additionally, 
GuardDuty uses machine learning to spot unusual patterns, like many failed login attempts, and it connects with external threat intelligence 
feeds to identify known malicious IP addresses, which helps it recognize attacks more effectively.
