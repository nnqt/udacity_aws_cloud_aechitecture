# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

Terrascan (https://github.com/tenable/terrascan-action)

### Example vulnerability

Terrascan can check your infrastructure code (like Terraform) for security issues. 
For example, it can find cases where an S3 bucket is not encrypted, which could expose sensitive data.

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

Grype (https://github.com/anchore/grype)

### Example vulnerability

Grype scans container images or AMIs for security weaknesses in software. For instance, it can find outdated versions 
of software that have known security flaws, such as an old version of Apache with vulnerabilities.

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

AWS Config (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html)

### Example vulnerability

AWS Config can help identify cloud configuration issues such as unrestricted security groups allowing SSH access from any IP address, violating security best practices.
